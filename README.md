## Overview

### Objective

The primary objective of this project was to develop a fully functional calculator app with a user-friendly interface. The app is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations and provide a seamless user experience across various devices.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript


### What I learned

By completing this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of CSS Grid and Flexbox display properties. Furthermore, I have learned how to create a toggle button for three themes and additional features. Additionally, I have attempted to store the userâ€™s preferred theme in local storage. Although I have not yet achieved full functionality, I am actively working on resolving this issue

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to continue focusing on several key areas:

Advanced CSS Techniques: I plan to further refine my skills in CSS Grid and Flexbox to create more complex and responsive layouts.

JavaScript Proficiency: Enhancing my understanding of JavaScript, particularly in relation to manipulating the DOM and managing state using local storage, remains a priority.

Theme Management: I am determined to perfect the implementation of theme toggling and ensure seamless user experience by successfully storing user preferences in local storage.

Accessibility Improvements: I intend to deepen my knowledge of web accessibility standards to ensure that all my projects are inclusive and usable by people with disabilities.

Performance Optimization: I want to explore and implement techniques for optimizing the performance of web applications, ensuring faster load times and better user experiences.

By concentrating on these areas, I aim to enhance the quality and functionality of my future projects.
